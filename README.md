Birthday Registration
=====================

This ship is a proof of concept.

A ship that fetches birthday and location from Facebook to pre-fill a form. If the user does not give the permissions or his profile does not contain those informations the field will not be pre-filled and the user will have to provide them.

The `profile_form` resource linked to the ship must have `birthday` and `location` fields.
